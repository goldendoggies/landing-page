# landing-page
This is the Landing Page I created using HTML and CSS as part of TOP.

Here is a link to the live website.
https://goldendoggies.github.io/landing-page/

This is a file that i will come back to and add to. style, content, maybe even some jvqscript once i learn!

In this project, it covers most items covered thus far in TOP Foundations path. 

This is a small test to understand using git better.
